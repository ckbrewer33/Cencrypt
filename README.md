(very) Simple encryption program

Program:  Cencryptor
Author:   Chris Brewer
Date:     10/30/2013
Function: This program takes a text file and encrypts it by incrementing the
           ASCII values of each character in the file by +1.  To decrypt a file,
           all the ASCII values of the characters in the encrypted file are
           decremented by 1.
           Obviously this is not a method to do any serious encryption with, and you can
           reverse the functions (tell it to decrypt first and it will be 'encrypted' and
           encrypt the file to 'decrypt' it) to get the same result.
